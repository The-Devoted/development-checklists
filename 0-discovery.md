# Technical Discovery and Research

- [ ] Begin a Technical Discovery Rubric for the project by creating a new
  Google Spreadsheet from the existing template, "Technical Discovery Rubric". The rubric will contain many tasks beyond what is documented here, and will serve as a technical reference for the project.
- [ ] Get access to the existing site's admin area, if possible.
- [ ] Get access to any existing analytics data.
- [ ] Schedule a technical discovery workshop or call, if needed beyond typical
  meetings.
- [ ] Begin communication with any necessary vendors or partners, such as
  hosting providers and third party tool collaborators.
- [ ] Complete the Technical Discovery Rubric.

## Existing Site Audit

- [ ] Capture "before" screenshots of front & back end of site, where possible.
- [ ] Run baseline performance and accessibility tests.
- [ ] Identify what content can be migrated automatically, if any.

## Extra Credit

These items _could_ be completed during discovery, or can be deferred to the
startup phase depending on the project's needs.

- [ ] Create a repository for the project (clone a starter kit where possible).
- [ ] Grant repository access to relevant team members.
