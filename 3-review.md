# QA, Migration, and Review

## Migration

- [ ] Ensure team member who will participate in migration have appropriate
  access to the CMS.
- [ ] Import any "automatic" exported migrated content.
- [ ] Review auto-migrated content for errors.
- [ ] Migrate manual content, leveraging for training where possible.
- [ ] Set a date for content freeze, if needed.

## Internal QA

- [ ] Ensure relevant internal team members have GitHub access and can submit issues.
- [ ] Share a list of QA links with team, to ensure QA covers all necessary site areas, sections, templates, or obscure hidden corners. Include things such as:
  - [ ] Archive pages
  - [ ] Search results
  - [ ] 404 page
  - [ ] Directions for triggering any hidden content (sliders, drawers, etc).

## Training
