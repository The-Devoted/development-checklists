# QA, Migration, and Review

## Migration

- [ ] Ensure team member who will participate in migration have appropriate
  access to the CMS.
- [ ] Import any "automatic" exported migrated content.
- [ ] Review auto-migrated content for errors.
- [ ] Migrate manual content, leveraging for training where possible.
- [ ] Set a date for content freeze, if needed.

## Internal QA Capture

- [ ] Ensure relevant internal team members have GitHub access and can submit
  issues.
- [ ] Share a list of QA links with team, to ensure QA covers all necessary site
  areas, sections, templates, or obscure hidden corners. Include things such as:
  - [ ] Archive pages
  - [ ] Search results
  - [ ] 404 page
  - [ ] Directions for triggering any hidden content (sliders, drawers, etc).
- [ ] Run performance tests and identify any issues that can be resolved or
  improved.
- [ ] Run accessibility tests and identify any issues to be resolved.
- [ ] Set an end date for internal QA.

## Full Team / Client QA Capture

- [ ] Ensure all relevant team members on client side have GitHub access and
  understand how to submit issues.
- [ ] Provide QA instructions if needed (provide a video where possible).
- [ ] Set an end date for client QA review.

## Issue Mitigation

- [ ] Triage issues from internal & client QA
- [ ] Identify any issues that are launch blockers.
- [ ] Identify any issues that will be addressed postlaunch.
- [ ] Determine if the launch date is still feasible given the results of QA.
- [ ] Validate that all parties are clear on what will and will not be going
  live at launch.

## Training

- [ ] Setup storage for any training videos, if needed.
- [ ] Schedule training sessions with relevant team members.
- [ ] Ensure User Guide is up to date, complete, and ready to share.
- [ ] Ensure custom fields have useful descriptive/help text.
- [ ] Review the "special cases" list of any unusual sections, methodologies, or
  processes for the site: things that are unique to this project and can't be
  found in CMS documentation.
  - [ ] Ensure these things are documented clearly (provide videos where
    possible).
