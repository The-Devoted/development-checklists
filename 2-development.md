# Development

✨ Make the things!

## Milestone / Release Planning

Milestones are likely to be planned rolling  as development progresses. At
startup, we plan our initial releases and set a launch date.

- [ ] Define a launch date.
- [ ] Create a `Launch` milestone within GitHub, dated with the planned launch
  date.
- [ ] Create an initial development release branch, for example, `development-release-v1`
- [ ] Generate issues for the first release, typically setting defaults and base styles.
- [ ] Add estimates to issues.
- [ ] Add a date to the first milestone, based on the issue estimates.
- [ ] Where possible, create additional milestones leading up to launch, working backward from the launch date.
- [ ] Review the content migration timeline and create issues for migration
  events where possible.

For each milestone, repeat the issue planning & estimate process.
