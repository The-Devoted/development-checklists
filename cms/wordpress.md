# WordPress Specific Tasks

- [ ] Rename the `wp-admin` login page url:
  - [ ] Use a security plugin or [implement manually](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24087198/rename-wordpress-admin-url-wp-admin) via `.htaccess`, `wp-config`, and `functions.php`.
  - [ ] Choose a name that is easy for clients to remember and type, but not obvious to potential hackers
  - [ ] Document the url somewhere available to the team, but hidden from public access (likely in the project readme)
- [ ] Review all [theme.json
  Settings](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/theme-json-reference/theme-json-living/#settings).
  Enable or disable based on the project's editor's abilities and the selected
  design.
